# 🧩 Cloud Service Models

Cloud services are categorized into **three main models**:  

## ☁️ IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
Provides virtualized computing resources online.  
*Example: AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine.*  

## 💻 PaaS (Platform as a Service)
Offers a development environment to build and deploy apps.  
*Example: Heroku, Google App Engine.*  

## 🧠 SaaS (Software as a Service)

> 🚀 *Each model abstracts different levels of control and responsibility.*
