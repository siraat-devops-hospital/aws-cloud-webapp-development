# 🛡️ Server Security Essentials

Security is a **non-negotiable part** of system administration. 🔒  

## 🔐 Core Measures
- **Firewall Configuration (ufw, iptables)**  
- **SSH Hardening** — Change default ports, disable root login.  
- **Regular Updates** — Keep packages patched.  
- **User Permissions** — Follow the principle of least privilege.
